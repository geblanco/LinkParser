# LinkParser
Episode link filter for tv shows and films we pages

This project is intended to be a chrome extension (working on it), by now it's just a command line application for node js.

The main idea is to avoid picking one link after another searching for the working ones in a tv show episode or movie. 
This application works this out for you!
