# LinkParser
Episode link filter for tv shows and films web pages

This project was intended to be a chrome extension there is a branch with a jquery version of this, but it is much slower, by now this is just a command line application for nodejs.

The main idea is to avoid picking one link after another searching for the working ones in a tv show episode or movie. 
This application works this out for you!

Right now it only supports “seriesyonkis.sx” and "seriesflv", but adding parsing rules for another web provider is fairy simple.
